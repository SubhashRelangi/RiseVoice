## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionality Overview

### Backend Architecture:

The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, providing a RESTful API.

*   **Server Setup:** `server.js` acts as the entry point, handling middleware (CORS, JSON/URL parsing, Multer for multipart data), connecting to MongoDB via Mongoose, and mounting API routes.
*   **Problem Module:** Manages all complaint-related operations. This includes creating problems with media uploads (handled by Cloudinary), retrieving problems (all, by ID, by coordinates), deleting problems, adding comments, and liking problems. It also supports updating problem statuses.
*   **Department Module:** Handles the full lifecycle of departmental accounts, from secure signup (with password hashing via bcrypt and custom `departmentId` generation) and email verification (using Nodemailer and generated codes) to JWT-based login with an additional layer of security through trusted device verification.
*   **Models:**
    *   `Problem.model.js`: Defines the schema for complaints, including details like title, description, category, location, media, status, likes, and comments.
    *   `Department.model.js`: Defines the schema for department accounts, including authentication details, department information, and verification status.
    *   `TrustedDevice.model.js`: Stores information about devices that have been verified for a department, enabling a smoother login experience on recognized devices.

### Frontend Architecture:

The frontend is a React.js single-page application, utilizing `react-router-dom` for navigation.

*   **Routing:** `App.js` centralizes all application routes, distinguishing between user-facing and departmental sections. It uses `ProtectedRoute` to secure departmental pages.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   **Citizen-Facing:** Provides intuitive forms for complaint submission (integrating camera/gallery and geolocation), a comprehensive tracking page with advanced filtering, and detailed views for individual complaints.
    *   **Departmental-Facing:** Features secure login and signup flows. Includes dashboard components for an overview of problem statistics and a map view. Departments can update complaint statuses and view attached media directly from the complaint details page.
*   **API Communication:** `axiosInstance.js` creates a centralized Axios instance for making API calls to the backend, with the base URL configured via environment variables.

## üí° Future Enhancements

We're continuously working to improve VoiceUp. Here are some planned features:

*   **Real-time Notifications:** Instant updates on complaint status changes.
*   **User Feedback System:** Allow citizens to provide feedback on resolved issues.
*   **Advanced Analytics:** Generate insights into complaint trends and resolution efficiency.
*   **Robust User Authentication:** Further enhance security and user management (e.g., password reset, multi-factor authentication).
*   **"Like Once" Enforcement:** Implement backend logic to ensure users can only like a problem once.
*   **Unified Branding:** Standardize brand name ("VoiceUp") across all components (e.g., footer).
*   **Improved Frontend Styling:** Refactor inline CSS into modules for better maintainability.
*   **Enhanced Departmental Links:** Update footer and header links to point to correct departmental pages.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

*   **"Resloved" Typo:** There is a known typo in the database where the "Resolved" status is sometimes misspelled as "Resloved". This has been addressed in the backend model to prevent validation errors, but data cleanup may still be beneficial.
