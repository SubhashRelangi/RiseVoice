# VoiceUp: Your Voice, Your Solution

**Connecting Citizens with Government Services, Seamlessly.**

## 1. Project Overview

VoiceUp is a **full-stack Complaint Management System** designed to bridge the gap between citizens and government services. It empowers users to easily raise and track issues related to various public services. Our goal is to foster transparency, accountability, and improved interaction between citizens and their local government.

This repository contains both the React-based frontend and a Node.js/Express.js backend for the VoiceUp application.

## 2. Features

*   **User Authentication:** UI components for secure login and signup functionalities.
*   **Complaint Submission:** A page to raise new complaints, including fields for:
    *   **Camera-based photo uploads** for visual evidence.
    *   Descriptive captions.
    *   Accurate location details with **auto-detection and manual adjustment capabilities**.
*   **Complaint Tracking:** A page for citizens to monitor the real-time status of their submitted complaints. **Complaints are dynamically fetched from the backend and can be filtered by ID, description, location, status, category, and date range.** The tracking page features an **enhanced and responsive UI**.
*   **Responsive User Interface:** A modern and intuitive design that adapts seamlessly across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    *   **Navigation Bar:** Provides easy access to Home, Services, Track, and Login pages, with **improved mobile responsiveness**.

    *   **Footer:** Contains essential links and social media integration.

## 3. Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React.js
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **Cloud Storage:** Cloudinary (for image uploads)

## 4. Installation Guide

To set up and run the VoiceUp application locally, follow these steps:

### 4.1. Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn
*   Git
*   MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
*   Cloudinary account (for image storage)

### 4.2. Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `backend` directory and add your environment variables:
    ```
    MONGODB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
    PORT=5000
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
4.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 4.3. Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or yarn start
    ```
    The frontend application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 5. Usage Guide

Once both the frontend and backend servers are running:

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  Explore the different pages and components of the application.
3.  You can now raise complaints with image uploads and location details, and these will be stored in the connected MongoDB database via the backend.
