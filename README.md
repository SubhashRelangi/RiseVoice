## ‚ú® Key Features

VoiceUp is packed with intuitive features designed to make your voice heard and problems resolved:

## üöÄ Tech Stack

Built with robust and modern technologies to ensure performance and scalability:

*   **Frontend:** React.js (a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
*   **Backend:** Node.js & Express.js (a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js)
*   **Database:** MongoDB (a flexible NoSQL database for storing complaint data)
*   **Cloud Storage:** Cloudinary (for secure and efficient image/video uploads and management)
*   **Email Service:** Nodemailer (for sending email verifications)
*   **Background Tasks:** Custom request scheduler (for keeping services active)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionality Overview

### Backend Architecture:

The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, providing a RESTful API.
*   **Server Setup:** `server.js` acts as the entry point, handling middleware (CORS, JSON/URL parsing, Multer for multipart data), connecting to MongoDB via Mongoose, and mounting API routes.
*   **Problem Module:** Manages all complaint-related operations. This includes creating problems with media uploads (handled by Cloudinary), retrieving problems (all, by ID, by coordinates), deleting problems, adding comments (with author information), and liking problems. It also now supports updating problem statuses.
*   **Department Module:** Handles the full lifecycle of departmental accounts, from secure signup (with password hashing via bcrypt and custom `departmentId` generation) and email verification (using Nodemailer and generated codes) to JWT-based login with optional IP validation.
*   **Utilities:** Includes an email service for sending verification codes and a request scheduler to send periodic HTTP GET requests, useful for maintaining server activity on certain hosting environments.

### Frontend Architecture:

The frontend is a React.js single-page application, utilizing `react-router-dom` for navigation.
*   **Routing:** `App.js` centralizes all application routes, distinguishing between user-facing and departmental sections.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   **Citizen-Facing:** Provides intuitive forms for complaint submission (integrating camera/gallery and geolocation), a comprehensive tracking page with advanced filtering (by ID, description, location, status, category, date), and detailed views for individual complaints with commenting capabilities (displaying author information).
    *   **Departmental-Facing:** Features secure login and signup flows. Includes dashboard components for an overview of problem statistics and a map view. Departments can now update complaint statuses and view attached media directly from the complaint details page.
*   **Global Components:** A consistent header, footer, and a floating button for quick complaint submission are integrated across the application. API calls are managed using Axios, with base URLs configured via environment variables for flexible deployment.

## üí° Future Enhancements

We're continuously working to improve VoiceUp. Here are some planned features:

*   **Real-time Notifications:** Instant updates on complaint status changes.
*   **User Feedback System:** Allow citizens to provide feedback on resolved issues.
*   **Advanced Analytics:** Generate insights into complaint trends and resolution efficiency.
*   **Robust User Authentication:** Further enhance security and user management (e.g., password reset, multi-factor authentication).
*   **"Like Once" Enforcement:** Implement backend logic to ensure users can only like a problem once.
*   **Unified Branding:** Standardize brand name ("VoiceUp") across all components (e.g., footer).
*   **Improved Frontend Styling:** Refactor inline CSS into modules for better maintainability.
*   **Enhanced Departmental Links:** Update footer and header links to point to correct departmental pages.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

*   **"Resloved" Typo:** There is a known typo in the database where the "Resolved" status is sometimes misspelled as "Resloved". This has been addressed in the backend model to prevent validation errors, but data cleanup may still be beneficial.
