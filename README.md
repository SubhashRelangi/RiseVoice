## 4. Installation Guide

To set up and run GovConnect locally, follow these steps:

### 4.1. Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn
*   MongoDB (local installation or cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
*   Git

### 4.2. Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd VoiceUp
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend # Assuming your backend code is in a 'backend' folder
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your MongoDB connection URI and any other necessary environment variables.
    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    PORT=5000
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```
5.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or node server.js
    ```
    The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 4.3. Frontend Setup

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend # Assuming your frontend code is in a 'frontend' folder
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**

    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or yarn start
    ```
    The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 5. Usage Guide
