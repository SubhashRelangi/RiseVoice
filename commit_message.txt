feat(admin): Centralize homepage data fetching

Refactored the Admin Homepage to consolidate data fetching for all its components (Map, Stats, Charts) into the main page component.

- Moved data fetching logic from `DepartmentMap`, `DashboardStats`, and `DepartmentCharts` into `AdminHomePage`.
- Implemented a single, coordinated loading state for the entire page, ensuring all components load their data before the page is displayed.
- Simplified child components into presentational components that receive data via props.
- Added a shared `Loader` component for the loading state.
- Improved efficiency by removing redundant API calls and data processing.
